This is the first time I'm writing something on a blog of my own, guys. I must say that I never knew composing a blog using Markdown was really possible. I had set up so many blogging platforms over the years using every frontend and backend stuff I learned, but as Da Vinci had correctly said:

> "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."

So, here we are, I'm using this neat little static site generator called **Hugo** to build my blog finally. Have even committed to writing one blog every Sunday.

Stay tuned on this space.

The plan is to make this place a collection of everything I love to explore on the internet and beyond.

_Adios, amigos!_ 🚀✨

```java
System.out.println("Hello world")
```
